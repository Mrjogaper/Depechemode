   <ul>
    <p style="font-size:150%">Fragile, like a baby in your arms <br>
      Be gentle with me, I'd never willingly do you harm <br>
      Apologies are all you seem to get from me <br>
      But just like a child, you make me smile when you care for me <br>
      And you know <br> <br>
      
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
      It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust <br>
      It is all of these things and more, that keep us together <br> <br>
      
      Independence is still important for us though <br>
      (We realise) It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go <br>
      (Do you know what I mean?) <br>
      My weaknesses, you know each and every one <br>
      (It frightens me) <br>
      I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's <br>
      And you know <br> <br>
      
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
      It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust <br>
      It is all of these things and more, that keep us together <br> <br>
       
      Kiss me goodbye when I'm on my own <br>
      But you know that I'd rather be home <br> <br>
      
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
      It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust <br>
      It is all of these things and more, that keep us together <br>
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
      It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust <br>
      It is all of these things and more, that keep us together <br> <br>
      
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
      It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust <br>
      It is all of these things and more, that keep us together <br>
      It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust <br>
